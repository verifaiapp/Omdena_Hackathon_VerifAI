## The Story Behind VerifAI
**[VerifAI](https://verifaiapp.streamlit.app)** is a passion project by [Jen Patrick Nataba](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cytojen/) and [John Ferry Lagman](https://www.linkedin.com/in/thatjohnlagman/).
With the sheer volume of digital content today, it‚Äôs becoming harder to tell what‚Äôs real and what‚Äôs not. For instance, a parent might share a heartwarming image online, believing it to be genuine, completely unaware that it‚Äôs been altered or is a deepfake. At the same time, many people fall victim to phishing scams, unknowingly clicking on malicious links that steal their personal information or drain their savings. These scenarios emphasize the urgent need for greater awareness and reliable tools to navigate a world filled with digital deception.  

But these aren't just stories; they are real challenges faced by millions of people. And it's these challenges that inspired **VerifAI**.

**VerifAI** started with a simple question: "How can we help people trust what they see, hear, and read?" From classrooms to social media feeds, VerifAI empowers users with cutting-edge tools to detect manipulated images, misleading audio, phishing links, and even AI-generated text. Designed with real-world scenarios in mind, our tools aim to make the digital space a safer and more credible place for everyone.

Our motivation is rooted in the experiences of vulnerable groups, particularly older users on social media and educators seeking academic integrity. By combining AI with purpose, VerifAI offers clarity in an increasingly complex digital age.

## Features
### üîç Deepfake Image Detector
- **Purpose**: Distinguish between real and AI-generated images.
- **Technology**: Utilizes state-of-the-art models from the Hugging Face library, enhanced with tailored datasets for real-world accuracy.
- **How It Works**: Preprocesses uploaded images, extracts features using pre-trained models, and classifies them as "Real" or "Fake" with confidence scores.

### üéôÔ∏è Deepfake Audio Detector
- **Purpose**: Verify the authenticity of audio recordings.
- **Technology**: Converts audio to spectrograms and classifies them using a convolutional neural network (CNN).
- **How It Works**: Generates a Mel spectrogram, processes it through a deep learning model, and outputs a label ("Real" or "Fake") with confidence scores.

### üåê Phishing Link Detector
- **Purpose**: Protect users from malicious phishing links.
- **Technology**: Leverages Hugging Face's DistilBERT for sequence classification.
- **How It Works**: Tokenizes the input URL, processes it through a fine-tuned DistilBERT model, and classifies the link as "Safe" or "Dangerous" with confidence scores.

### üìù Extras: AI Text Detector (Experimental)
- **Purpose**: Identify AI-generated text.
- **Technology**: Custom-trained machine learning model leveraging TF-IDF and Scikit-learn pipelines.
- **How It Works**: Preprocesses input text by removing stopwords and punctuation, tokenizes it, and predicts whether the text is human-written or AI-generated.

- **Deepfake Audio Detector**: This feature allows users to upload or select an audio file for verification. Users can:
  - Upload their own audio recordings in formats like WAV or MP3.
  - Choose from provided test files for demonstration purposes.
  - View confidence scores indicating how likely the audio is real or fake.
  - See spectrogram visualizations of the uploaded audio, which represent the frequencies analyzed by the model.

- **Deepfake Image Detector**: This tool lets users verify the authenticity of images. Features include:
  - Uploading images in formats like PNG or JPEG for analysis.
  - Selecting from test image files provided in the application for quick testing.
  - Real-time processing of the image to determine if it is real or AI-generated.
  - A confidence score that quantifies the result, helping users make informed decisions.

- **Phishing Link Detector**: Aimed at preventing phishing scams, this tool enables users to:
  - Enter a URL manually to check its safety.
  - Select from a list of sample URLs (both safe and dangerous) for testing.
  - Receive a clear classification of the link as "Safe" or "Dangerous," along with the confidence percentage.
  - Get visual feedback through color-coded results, ensuring intuitive interpretation.

- **Extras (AI Text Detector)**: This experimental feature focuses on detecting AI-generated text. Users can:
  - Type or paste text directly into the input area for analysis.
  - Upload text files to process longer documents.
  - Choose from sample texts categorized as human- or AI-generated for comparison.
  - Receive detailed feedback on whether the text is classified as "Human-generated" or "AI-generated," with an accompanying confidence score.
